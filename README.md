# studentPortal

## Description
A dynamic, fully responsive web site from posting campus announcement as images, Built from scratch

## Motivation
As a school assignement, we were tasked with designing and implementing a website where students can stay updated with various sorts of announcements that usually take the form of posters on the campus (Grades, schedule updates, news...).

## Personal anecdote
This projects was empowering to me because in a span of three weeks I went from not knowing a single HTML tag to developing this website (Thanks to Openclassrooms very well structured tuto pdf ([Apprenez à créer votre site web avec HTML5 et CSS3](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/1603881-apprenez-a-creer-votre-site-web-avec-html5-et-css3) & [Concevez votre site web avec PHP et MySQL](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/918836-concevez-votre-site-web-avec-php-et-mysql) & [Adapter son site au format mobile avec CSS3](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/1708611-adapter-son-site-au-format-mobile-avec-css3))

Also, because this was the first website I ever built, _(you can imagine the feeling)_
